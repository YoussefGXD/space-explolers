                        Since 1975, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) have provided continuous imagery and data on atmospheric conditions and solar activity (space weather). They have even aided in search and rescue of people in distress. GOES data products have led to more accurate and timely weather forecasts and better understanding of long-term climate conditions.

                        GEOSAT, was launched on 12 March
                        1985, into an 800-km, 108-deg inclination orbit, carried an altimeter
                        that was capable of the distance from satellite to sea surface with a
                        relative precision of about 5 cm. After a classified mission for the
                        Navy, GEOSAT's scientific Exact Repeat Mission (ERM) began on 8
                        November 1986 after it was manoeuvred into a seventeen-day repeat

                        The Advanced Earth Observation Satellite (ADEOS) was the first international
                        space platform dedicated to Earth environment research developed and operated by
                        the Japan National Space Development Agency (NASDA) (the Japanese call it
                        MIDORI). The TOMS instrument along with the NSCAT (NASA spectrometer
                        designed to study wind speed and direction) were a key US component of the
                        platform. ADEOS was launched on August 17, 1996 (01:53 UTC) into a sunsynchronous sub-orbital at an altitude of about 830 km by the H-II launch vehicle
                        from the Tanegashima Space Center.
                        On June 30, 1997, the ADEOS spacecraft failed and was replaced by NASA's
                        EarthProbe/TOMS probe.

                        ACRIMSAT is a NASA funded minisatellite mission to monitor the amount of total solar energy received (part of EOS program). The objective is to monitor the solar constant, or TSI (Total Solar Irradiation), with maximum precision and provide an important link in the long-term TSI database. ACRIMSAT is part of a multi-decade effort to understand variations in the sun's output and resulting effects on Earth.

                        The CHAMP mission inaugurated a new era in
                        geopotential research by: <br>
                        1) mapping the global gravitational field long to
                        mean wavelength and temporal variations. <br>
                        2) mapping of the Earth's global magnetic field and time changes and. <br>
                        3) Sounding of the atmosphere/ionosphere. <br> <br>
                        As a result, CHAMP data has applications in global climate studies, oceanography,
                        weather forecasting, disaster research, navigation, geophysics, geodesy, and solar
                        geophysics.

                        climate, particularly how ocean circulation impacts Earth's hydrological and
                        biogeochemical cycles. <br>
                        • Study the variation of ocean circulation, on time scales ranging from
                        seasonal and annual to decadal, and how this variation impacts climate
                        change. <br>
                        • Collaborate with other global ocean-monitoring programs to produce
                        routine models of the global ocean for scientific and operational
                        applications. <br>
                        • Study large-scale ocean tides. <br>
                        • Study geophysical processes and their effects on ocean surface topography. <br>

                        OCO's mission: <br>
                        was to provide space-based observations of atmospheric
                        carbon dioxide (CO2), the main human-initiated driver of
                        climate change. This mission used mature technologies to meet
                        NASA's highest priority carbon cycle measurement
                        requirements. The OCO launch was unsuccessful on February
                        24, 2009 due to a launch vehicle malfunction. The Orbiting
                        Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) is scheduled to launch in mid2014.

                        The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS), is a space-based instrument used to detect
                        the distribution and variability of total lightning (cloud-to-cloud, intra-cloud, and
                        cloud-to-ground lightning). It measures the amount, rate, and radiant energy of
                        lightning during both day and night. Two LIS instruments were built in the 1990s,
                        one for the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and a spare which
                        was stored on a shelf for over 20 years. A summary of the two platforms
                        highlights the differences. The TRMM LIS operated successfully for over 17
                        years, from launch in 1997 until April 2015. The spare LIS was placed in Feb 2017
                        on the International Space Station (ISS) for a two - four year mission.

                        The TSIS-1 mission will
                        provide absolute
                        measurements of the total solar irradiance (TSI) and spectral solar
                        irradiance (SSI), important for accurate scientific models of climate
                        change and solar variability. TSIS is comprised of two instruments, the
                        Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM), and the Spectral Irradiance Monitor
                        (SIM). Both instruments are in storage at the University of Colorado’s
                        Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics awaiting flight.
                        Currently, the data from an earlier NASA-managed TIM instrument,
                        flying on the aging SORCE spacecraft, launched in 2003, provides the
                        TSI data record as part of an unbroken 35-year long data record. The
                        Total Solar Irradiance Calibration Transfer Experiment (TCTE)
                        instrument, a joint mission with NOAA and the U.S. Air Force,
                        launched in 2013 and currently augments the data record. The TSIS-1
                        project will begin formulation in FY 2016 and is planning for launch in
                        time to overlap with the TCTE mission in order to maintain continuity
                        of the solar irradiance measurement.

                        We live on a solar-powered
                        planet. The Sun provides almost
                        all of the energy that fuels life
                        and drives the Earth’s ocean currents, seasons, weather, and climate.
                        For scientists who study changes in Earth’s climate, energy from the
                        Sun is a factor that they can’t ignore.
                        NASA's Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor – 2, or TSIS-2, will
                        measure the Sun's energy input to Earth. Since 1978, various satellites
                        have measured the Sun’s brightness above Earth’s atmosphere. TSIS-2
                        will add solar irradiance measurements to four decades of continuous
                        data records. Unlike its predecessor TSIS-1, which operates from the
                        International Space Station, TSIS-2 will ride on a free-flying
                        spacecraft.
                        Measurements of Earth’s solar energy input is simply a measurement
                        of the Sun’s brightness at the top of Earth’s atmosphere. TSIS-2
                        measures the brightness of the sun that reaches the earth, called total
                        irradiance, as well as the distribution of that energy over ultraviolet,
                        visible, and infrared wavelengths, called spectral irradiance.
